 * LAX_STATS_UPDATE_INT - Periodic update of load averages
 *
 * Functional description:
 *
 *   This routine performs a once-a-second update of the load average data.
 *   The algorithm is the same as the original LAXDRIVER, except that the
 *   system load average is not divided by the number of active CPUs, and
 *   the values are all returned as 32-bit unsigned integers representing
 *   fixed-point values with a binary scaling factor of 14 bits.
 *
 * Calling convention:
 *
 *   lax_stats_update_int (fr3, ucb, tqe)
 *
 * Input parameters:
 *
 *   fr3	Unused
 *   ucb        Pointer to unit control block
 *   tqe        Pointer to TQE used to time request
 *
 * Output parameters:
 *
 *   None.
 *
 * Return value:
 *
 *   None.
 *
 * Environment:
 * 
 *   Kernel mode, system context, at timer IPL.
